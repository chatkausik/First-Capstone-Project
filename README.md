First Capstone Project -- Movie IMDB Score Recommendation
Predict IMDB movie rating by Kausik Chattapadhyay (chat.kausik@gmail.com) 

Background:
How can we tell the greatness of a movie before it is released in cinema? 
This question puzzled me for a long time since there is no universal way to claim the goodness of movies. Many people rely on critics to gauge the quality of a film, while others use their instincts. But it takes the time to obtain a reasonable amount of critics review after a movie is released. And human instinct sometimes is unreliable.

Question:
Given that thousands of movies were produced each year, is there a better way for us to tell the greatness of movie without relying on critics or our own instincts?
Will the number of human faces in movie poster correlate with the movie rating?
